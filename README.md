# Dependencies

## Glad

You may need to [get a glad] if you don't have one
and either put it to `third-party`
directory as it's done in the following example
or wherever you want, just don't forget to modify the Makefile
(all entries with `GLAD`).

## OpenGL

You need to have a graphical card compatible with OpenGL
and at least GLSL 1.1.

## GLFW 3

You need [GLFW] 3 to be installed.
